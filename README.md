This widget shows currently played song in either iTunes or Spotify. It has a spiffy progress bar, shows pretty artwork (external dependency: pretty artwork) and last but not least: it comes in **three variants**!

## Features

- Supports both Spotify and iTunes
- Shows artwork (courtesy of [last.fm](www.last.fm))
- Progress bar
- Three size variants
- Easy way to toggle the widget's visibility
- Easy way to position the widget on the screen
- Spiffy fade animation on pause

## Options

Here's how you can set all the widget's options. Open `index.coffee` and look at the very beginning:

```
options =
  # Easily enable or disable the widget.
  widgetEnable: true

  # Choose your widget.
  widgetVariant: "medium"       # large | medium | small

  # Choose where the widget should sit on your screen.
  vPosition: "bottom"           # top | bottom | center

```
